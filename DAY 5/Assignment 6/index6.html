        <h1>Question 6</h61>
        <h2><p>Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'<br><br>
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number-ask them to input again.<br>
    <br>
    The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.<br><br>
    Here we can assume that the visitor only enters numbers. There's no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</p></h2>
