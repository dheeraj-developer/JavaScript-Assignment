        <h1>Question 7</h1>          
            <p><h2>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.<br>
            <br>In other words, n>1 is a prime number if it can't be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.<br>
            <br>
            For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without any remainder 2, 3 and 4.</h2>
            <h1>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</h1>
            <h2>For n=10, the result will be 2, 3, 5, 7.<br><br>
            P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.</h2></p>
