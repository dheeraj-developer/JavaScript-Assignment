        <h2><p>--> Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping<br>
        --> So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy.<br>
        --> Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to add a few more.<br>
        --> Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some new products into it.</p></h2>
